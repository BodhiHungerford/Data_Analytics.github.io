This Data has come from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. 

The name of the dataset is : Payroll Based Journal Daily Nurse Staffing - Q1 of 2024.

I'll post the link to the dataset description, called Payroll Based Journal Methodology.

This dataset is summarized as, "daily data on nursing home staffing levels based on data submitted by nursing homes to CMS through the Payroll Based Journal 
(PBJ) system and daily resident census information based on Minimum Data Set (MDS) records."

The reasoning for this dataset is described as, "Long-term care (LTC) facilities must electronically submit to CMS through the PBJ system complete and accurate direct care staffing information, 
including information for agency and contract staff, based on payroll and other verifiable and auditable data in a uniform format according to 
specifications established by CMS. Facilities are required to submit the number of hours that each staff member (including agency and contract staff) is 
paid to deliver services for each day worked."

There are some limitations to the dataset. They are 
"Total nurse staffing = 0 hours per resident per day2; or
Total nurse staffing > 12 hours per resident per day; or
Nurse aide staffing > 5.25 hours per resident per day.
Total nurse staffing on weekends = 0 hours per resident per day3
Total nurse staffing on weekends >12 hours per resident per day3
Total nurse aide staffing on weekends > 5.25 hours per resident per day3"

"Administrator Exclusion Criteria

Administrator staffing data is excluded4 from the PBJ PUFs if the nursing home submitted PBJ data suggesting an erroneously high number of administrators. 
Specifically, if a nursing home reports administrator hours (job code 1) for five or more individuals (based on employee IDs) on 4 or more days during the 
quarter, the administrator staffing hours will be excluded and flagged as invalid."

Additionally there is a warning on the limitations of the data, "Note that the exclusions for aberrant nurse staffing levels are applied to facilitiesâ€™ data 
aggregated across all days (or all weekend days for exclusions 4, 5 and 6) in the entire quarter, not for individual days. As a result, some extremely high 
and low daily values exist in the data, and in particular, none of the inclusion or exclusion criteria require that facilities reported RN or LPN hours. 
Analysts may wish to apply additional edits to the data and should be cautious in the interpretation of extreme values.   It should also be noted that 
facilities are instructed to report only paid hours; yet, some staff, particularly salaried workers, may work additional hours that are unpaid and 
unreported."

My original exploration was focused on determining KPI's for further exploration. After identifying the hours collected as a key asset I determined 
to break down the hours of each location and needing a compartive value I decided to compare the individual location data to the data as a whole.

Note: Due to the size of the data, I broke it down into two datasets. One was states from A-L and the second was states from M-Z.
