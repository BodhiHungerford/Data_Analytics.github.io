BMI Calculator

# Below is a BMI Calculator I developed using Jupyter Notebook. When you run the code, you will be prompted to 
# enter your name, weight, and height details. The code will then calculate your BMI and indicate where you fall 
# on the BMI scale. Here's how I built it:

# 1. Created input prompts for name, height and weight.
# 2. Defined the formula to calculate BMI.
# 3. Used IF, ELIF, and ELSE statements to categorize the results into different BMI ranges.


name = input("Enter your name: ")

weight = float(input("Enter your weight in pounds: "))

height = float(input("Enter your height in inches: "))

BMI = (weight * 703)/(height * height)

print(BMI)

if BMI>0:
    if(BMI < 16.0):
        print(name + ", You are Severly Underweight. Seek medical help.")
    elif(BMI < 18.5):
        print(name + ", You are Underweight.")
    elif(BMI < 25):
        print(name + ", You are Normal.")
    elif(BMI < 30):
        print(name + ", You are Overweight.")
    elif(BMI < 35):
        print(name + ", You are Moderately Obese. Hit the gym.")
    elif(BMI < 40):
        print(name + ", You are Severely Obese. Less pizza, more pushups.")
    else:
        print(name + ", You are Morbidly Obese. Seek medical help.")
else:
    print("Enter valid input")
